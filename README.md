# Geometry_Game



<strong> the game is about users guessing points inside a rectangle. Rectangles have coordinates for their lower-left and upper-right corners and            points also have coordinates.So we will create game which will have following Functionality:-
</strong>
 <ul>
  <li>we will get Rectangle coordinates for their lower-left and upper-right corners randomly and print the rectangle co-ordinates</li>
  <li>after printing Rectangle co-ordinate guess what Point co-ordinate will fall in that rectangle by User-Input </li>
  <li>check if point falls in rectangle return True if falls else return True</li>
  <li>Guess the area of rectangle User-Input</li>
  <li>return the actual area of rectangle</li>
  <li>distance between 2 point 1:-the point we guess which fall in rect or not 2:-provide any point and print the Distance</li>
  <li>Create Rectangle Graphically </li>
  <li>locate the guessing Point also on GUI</li>
 </ul>
